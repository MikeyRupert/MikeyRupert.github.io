Now some folks say batman was the baddest man the world has ever seen.
But I want you to light up a joint, screw your wig on tight, and let me tell you about the little bad mother‑fucker called Migel!
He was born in a barrel of butcher knives. I’ve been shot in my rear with two Colt‑45s. I’ve been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel. I chew up railroad iron and spit out steel. I jumped into the ocean and swallowed a whale. I handcuffed lightning and threw thunder’s ass in jail. I put fear in a gorilla and took the sting from a bee. So if you think you’ve seen a superhero, buckle up—because you ain’t seen nothin’ yet, not even a shadow of what of what will be.

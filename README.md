Now, some folks say Batman was the baddest man the world has ever seen.
But I want you to light up a joint, screw your wig on tight, and let me tell you about a little bad mofo called Miguel!

He was born in a barrel of butcher knives.
He’s been shot in the rear with two Colt .45s.
He’s been slapped by a bear and bitten by an eel.
He chews up railroad iron and spits out steel.
He once jumped into the ocean and swallowed a whale—then handcuffed lightning and threw thunder’s ass in jail.
He put fear into a gorilla and took the sting from a bee.

So if you think you’ve seen a superhero, buckle up—because you ain’t seen nothin’ yet, not even a shadow of what’s to come.
